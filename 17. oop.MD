Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Dart

OOP is a programming paradigm centered around the concept of "objects," which are instances of
"classes." A class serves as a blueprint, and an object is a specific entity created from that
blueprint. OOP aims to model real-world entities and their interactions within software.

**Key Principles of OOP:**

- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential information to
  the user.
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on that data
  within a single unit (the class). This protects data integrity.
- **Inheritance:** Creating new classes (child classes) based on existing ones (parent classes),
  inheriting their properties and behaviors. This promotes code reuse and establishes relationships
  between classes.
- **Polymorphism:** The ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method call
  in their own specific way. This allows for flexibility and extensibility.

**OOP Concepts in Dart:**

Dart is a fully object-oriented language where everything is an object.

**1. Class:**

- A blueprint or template for creating objects.
- Defines the properties (data) and methods (functions) that objects of that class will have.
- **Example:** A `Car` class might have properties like `color`, `model`, and `year`, and methods
  like `start()`, `accelerate()`, and `brake()`.

**2. Object:**

- An instance of a class.
- A concrete realization of the blueprint defined by the class.
- **Example:** `myCar = Car(color: 'red', model: 'Sedan', year: 2023)` creates an object named
  `myCar` based on the `Car` class.

**3. Class and Object Relationship:**

- Classes define the structure, and objects are the actual entities created from that structure.
- Multiple objects can be created from a single class, each with its own unique data.

**4. Constructor:**

- A special method within a class that's automatically called when an object of that class is
  created.
- Its primary purpose is to initialize the object's properties.

**5. Types of Constructors:**

- **Default Constructor:** If no constructor is defined, Dart provides a default one (with no
  parameters).
- **Parameterized Constructor:** A constructor that accepts parameters to initialize the object's
  properties with specific values.
- **Named Constructor:** Allows defining multiple constructors with different names within a class,
  providing flexibility in object creation.
- **Constant Constructor:** Used to create compile-time constant objects. All properties must be
  `final`.
- **Factory Constructor:** Used to create objects in a more flexible way. It can return a cached
  object or an object of a subclass.

**6. Encapsulation:**

- Bundling data (properties) and methods that operate on that data within a class.
- In Dart, achieved using the `_` (underscore) prefix for properties and methods, making them
  private to the class's library.

**7. Getter:**

- A special method that allows reading the value of a property.
- Doesn't take any parameters and returns a value.

**8. Setter:**

- A special method that allows modifying the value of a property.
- Takes a single parameter (the new value) and doesn't return anything.

**9. Getters and Setters:**

- Often used together to control how properties are accessed and modified, providing a layer of
  validation or logic.

**10. Inheritance:**

- A mechanism where a new class (subclass/child) can inherit properties and methods from an existing
  class (superclass/parent).
- Uses the `extends` keyword.
- Promotes code reuse and establishes "is-a" relationships (e.g., a `SportsCar` is a `Car`).

**11. Inheritance of Constructors:**

- Constructors are not directly inherited.
- Subclasses can call the superclass's constructor using the `super()` keyword in their own
  constructor's initialization list.

**12. Super Keyword:**

- Used within a subclass to refer to the superclass.
- Allows calling the superclass's methods or constructor.

**13. Polymorphism:**

- "Many forms."
- Allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common type.
- Achieved through inheritance and method overriding.
- **Example:** If `Dog` and `Cat` both inherit from `Animal`, they can be treated as `Animal`
  objects, and calling a `makeSound()` method will behave differently for each.

**14. Static:**

- `static` members (properties and methods) belong to the class itself, not to any specific object.
- Accessed using the class name (e.g., `ClassName.staticMethod()`).
- Useful for utility functions or shared data.

**15. Enum:**

- Enumerated types.
- A way to define a set of named constants.
- **Example:** `enum Color { red, green, blue }`

**16. Abstract Class:**

- A class that cannot be instantiated directly.
- Serves as a blueprint for subclasses.
- May contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that subclasses must implement.

**17. Interface:**

- Dart doesn't have a specific `interface` keyword.
- Any class can be used as an interface.
- When a class implements another class, it must provide implementations for all of the methods of
  the implemented class.

**18. Mixin:**

- A way to reuse a class's code in multiple class hierarchies.
- Similar to multiple inheritance, but with some restrictions.
- Uses the `mixin` keyword.
- A class can use multiple mixins.

**19. Factory Constructor:**

- A constructor that doesn't necessarily create a new instance of its class.
- It can return an existing instance or an instance of a subclass.
- Useful for implementing caching or complex object creation logic.

**20. Generics:**

- Allow writing code that can work with different types without knowing the specific type at compile
  time.
- Uses angle brackets `<>` to specify type parameters.
- **Example:** `List<int>` is a list that can only hold integers.
